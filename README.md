# PewTseJS
Welcome to PewTseJs. Try to say that 5 times in a row. This web app built with JavaScript, jQuery and Materialize CSS and provides a subscriber difference between PewDiePie and T-Series on YouTube.

Will be soon archived because the changes to the Youtube v3 data API   
*this repo didn't last long unfortunately*
